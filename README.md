# Hack-Off

We built and trained a convolutional neural network in Keras with TensorFlow as backend to detect if a patient is infected with COVID or not using their chest x-ray images. Our main aim is to create an image classifier with Tensorflow by implementing a CNN to differentiate between chest x rays images with a COVID 19 infections versus without. The dataset contains the lungs X-ray images of both groups i.e Covid Positive and Negative patients. We fit our model with the training data. This model can now be helpful to make predictions on new data.
We have also integrated the model with a website using streamlit.
